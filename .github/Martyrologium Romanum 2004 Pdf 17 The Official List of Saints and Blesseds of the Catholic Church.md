The latest edition of the Martyrologium Romanum was published in 2004, following the approval of Pope John Paul II. It contains 17 more pages than the previous edition of 2001, and includes 117 new entries of saints and blesseds who were canonized or beatified between 2001 and 2004. Some of the notable additions are St. Josemaria Escriva, founder of Opus Dei; St. Gianna Beretta Molla, a mother and doctor who sacrificed her life for her unborn child; St. Josephine Bakhita, a former slave who became a nun; and St. Pedro Calungsod, a young Filipino catechist who was martyred in Guam.
 
The Martyrologium Romanum 2004 also incorporates some changes in the names, dates, and biographies of some saints and blesseds, based on historical research and liturgical reforms. For example, St. Valentine, the patron saint of love and marriage, is no longer celebrated on February 14, but on July 6; St. Christopher, the patron saint of travelers, is no longer included in the universal calendar, but only in some local calendars; and St. Philomena, a popular saint among devotees, is no longer mentioned in the Martyrologium Romanum, as her existence and martyrdom are not historically verified.
